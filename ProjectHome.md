## A bit of history ##

GeDA was started in 2009 to help generalize approach to DTO pattern as this process can become quite tedious in large scale n-tier applications. We were first to adopt unique approach to byte code generation of classes to speed up data transfer between DTO and Entity object and we still remain the [fastest](http://www.inspire-software.com/confluence/display/GeDA/Benchmarks) and the most feature rich library.
